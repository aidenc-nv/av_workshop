{"name":"background_change","prompt_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/cosmos-robotics-sa-training/prompts/prompt_background.txt","prompt":"A realistic, static full-body shot of a young man standing outdoors near the coast. He has short dark hair and is dressed casually in a dark grey t-shirt, loose black pants, and white sneakers, with an ID badge clipped to his waistband. He faces the camera directly and waves his right hand continuously in a friendly greeting. The surrounding environment is bright and open. In the background, a vast ocean stretches out toward the horizon, with gentle waves, shimmering reflections, and a clear blue sky above. A coastal walkway with railings and scattered pedestrians lines the foreground, replacing the busy city street elements. Soft natural lighting from the sun enhances the calm, breezy seaside atmosphere.","negative_prompt":"The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. Overall, the video is unrealistic at all.","seed":2025,"guidance":3,"video_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/cosmos-robotics-sa-training/assets/wave.mp4","image_context_path":null,"num_conditional_frames":1,"resolution":"720","sigma_max":null,"num_video_frames_per_chunk":93,"num_steps":35,"show_control_condition":false,"show_input":false,"keep_input_resolution":true,"edge":{"control_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/cosmos-robotics-sa-training/assets/filtered_edge.mp4","control_weight":1.0,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null,"preset_edge_threshold":"medium"},"depth":null,"vis":{"control_path":null,"control_weight":0.1,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null,"preset_blur_strength":"medium"},"seg":{"control_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/cosmos-robotics-sa-training/assets/seg.mp4","control_weight":0.4,"mask_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/cosmos-robotics-sa-training/assets/reverse_mask.mp4","mask_prompt":null,"control_prompt":null}}
