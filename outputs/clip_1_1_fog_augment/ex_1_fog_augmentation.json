{"name":"ex_1_fog_augmentation","prompt_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/milestone_workshop/scripts/../assets/other_av_assets/clip_1_1_fog_augment.txt","prompt":"This video clip features an overhead, slightly elevated perspective capturing a complex, busy intersection controlled by traffic lights and multiple turning lanes during a snowy winter day. Various vehicles traverse the snow-dusted, icy pavement: a large black pickup truck drives across the foreground, quickly followed by a silver/gray pickup truck making a turn from the left, a dark blue/gray SUV proceeding straight through, and finally a white sedan crossing the frame. The intersection is framed on the left by snow-covered commercial buildings, but the majority of the background is dominated by a moderately steep, heavily wooded hillside completely blanketed in deep, untouched snow, emphasizing a stark, cold atmosphere under a gray, overcast sky.","negative_prompt":"The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. Overall, the video is unrealistic at all.","seed":2025,"guidance":7,"video_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/milestone_workshop/scripts/../assets/other_av_assets/clip_2_1.mp4","image_context_path":null,"num_conditional_frames":1,"resolution":"720","sigma_max":null,"num_video_frames_per_chunk":93,"num_steps":35,"show_control_condition":false,"show_input":false,"keep_input_resolution":true,"edge":{"control_path":null,"control_weight":0.5,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null,"preset_edge_threshold":"medium"},"depth":{"control_path":null,"control_weight":1.0,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null},"vis":null,"seg":null}
