This video clip presents an overhead, slightly elevated view capturing a multi-lane intersection with active traffic lights, basking in the bright, warm glow of morning sunlight. Various modern SUVs and vans are moving through the intersection on dry pavement: a dark blue/gray Ford Edge crosses first, followed by a white Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is quickly succeeded by a white U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivery van, and finally, a black Kia Carnival minivan. The scene is framed on the left by commercial buildings that catch the morning light, while the background is dominated by a moderately steep, dry wooded hillside, now illuminated by the gentle, golden rays of the early sun, giving the entire urban landscape a crisp, well-lit appearance.
