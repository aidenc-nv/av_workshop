{"name":"ex_2_lighting_augmentation","prompt_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/milestone_workshop/scripts/../assets/other_av_assets/clip_1_2_lighting_augment.txt","prompt":"This video clip presents an overhead, slightly elevated view capturing a multi-lane intersection with active traffic lights, basking in the bright, warm glow of morning sunlight. Various modern SUVs and vans are moving through the intersection on dry pavement: a dark blue/gray Ford Edge crosses first, followed by a white Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is quickly succeeded by a white U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivery van, and finally, a black Kia Carnival minivan. The scene is framed on the left by commercial buildings that catch the morning light, while the background is dominated by a moderately steep, dry wooded hillside, now illuminated by the gentle, golden rays of the early sun, giving the entire urban landscape a crisp, well-lit appearance.","negative_prompt":"The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. Overall, the video is unrealistic at all.","seed":2025,"guidance":3,"video_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/milestone_workshop/scripts/../assets/other_av_assets/clip_2_2.mp4","image_context_path":null,"num_conditional_frames":1,"resolution":"720","sigma_max":null,"num_video_frames_per_chunk":93,"num_steps":35,"show_control_condition":false,"show_input":false,"keep_input_resolution":true,"edge":{"control_path":null,"control_weight":1.0,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null,"preset_edge_threshold":"medium"},"depth":{"control_path":null,"control_weight":0.9,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null},"vis":null,"seg":null}
