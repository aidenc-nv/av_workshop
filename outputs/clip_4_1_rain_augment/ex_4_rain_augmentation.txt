This video clip captures a mid-level view of a multi-lane, curved urban street with heavy, slow-moving traffic in both directions, set during a downpour of heavy rain. The road is completely soaked, with streams and puddles of water visible, reflecting the distorted lights of the surrounding vehicles. The focus is on the vehicles: a white luxury crossover, a dark gray sedan, and an older, dark pickup truck are prominent in the foreground of the lane heading toward the viewer. The opposite lane is a solid queue of cars waiting in traffic. Pedestrians carrying umbrellas are visible walking along the sidewalks on both sides of the street, which is lined with wet, dark-barked trees and utility poles. The heavy rain creates a dark, saturated, and highly reflective atmosphere across the entire scene.
