{"name":"ex_3_night_augmentation","prompt_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/milestone_workshop/scripts/../assets/other_av_assets/clip_3_1_night_augment.txt","prompt":"This video clip captures a low-angle, eye-level view of heavy, slow-moving traffic stopped at a red light on a multi-lane highway on-ramp or service road, set dramatically at night. The road surface is wet, reflecting the harsh glare of streetlights, headlights, and the red glow of the traffic signal. The foreground is dominated by a tight queue of vehicles, including a dark pickup truck towing a trailer of equipment, a large semi-trailer truck, and several passenger cars. In the right lane of the main highway, a dark SUV is seen driving past the stopped traffic. The background consists of dark, indistinct commercial areas and a parking lot full of cars on the left, with the entire scene lit only by artificial lights against a dark, night sky, creating a contrast between the bright light sources and the deep shadows.","negative_prompt":"The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. Overall, the video is unrealistic at all.","seed":2025,"guidance":3,"video_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/milestone_workshop/scripts/../assets/other_av_assets/clip_3_1.mp4","image_context_path":null,"num_conditional_frames":1,"resolution":"720","sigma_max":null,"num_video_frames_per_chunk":93,"num_steps":35,"show_control_condition":false,"show_input":false,"keep_input_resolution":true,"edge":{"control_path":null,"control_weight":0.5,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null,"preset_edge_threshold":"medium"},"depth":{"control_path":null,"control_weight":1.0,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null},"vis":null,"seg":null}
